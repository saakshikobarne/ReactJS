gitignore: this file contains the files that should be ignored by git while pushing the codebase to github

package-lock.json: this file is similar to package.json file but here, the dependancies are locked
    for a particular version (only works for particular version)
    In other words, stable version of dependancies is locked here.

readme.md: is an introduction file of the project where all the project details are documented

inside the public folder (when apps are created using create-react-app)
manifest file: is useful for mobile devices when we open the websites in mobile phones
robots.txt: is for the search engine



Some rules to follow while writing react code:
(in vite)

files should have extensions of .jsx
function name (also referred to as component in react) should always start from capital letter
while returning the components, we can return only one component from the function
when in stituations we have to return more than just one component we would wrap all the components in a div 
to avoid using many divs, react provided with an option to return empty fragments for wrapping up the content
these <></> are called as fragments.


(using create-react-app) 
if the practises of capitalization of the function names and tags is not followed,
unlike in vite which throws an error, this method does not render the object instead of generating any error

NOTE: functions which we are exporting and importing are the components itself
