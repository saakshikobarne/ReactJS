Threre are several ways to create react apps:


1. By create react app method
navigate to the folder
>npx create-react-app appname

creating react app by this process is a slow process as it installes bulky libraries which may not be even needed

When installed, there is a file called `package.json` which has all the information related to the react dependancies.

to run the react code, we shall execute the following command:
>npm run start


2. since the create react app is a bulky method and a slow process, we will use the second method:

to create a react app using vite, first navigate to the folder 
>npm create vite@latest

fill in the project name
select the framework (react+js)

this method doesn't provide node modules as in the create react app method

since the node modules folder is not present in this case, to run the project, we have to install it first
so to install, first navigate to the project folder and
>npm i 
or
>npm install

now, the required packages would be installed with that

to run the project now, 
>npm run dev
